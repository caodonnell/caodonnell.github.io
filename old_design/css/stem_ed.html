Here are some examples of how I've gotten training in science communication and applied it to policy and teaching. </h5>

      <h5> In 2017-2018, I participated
	in the <a href="https://isee.ucsc.edu/programs/pdp/">
	  Professional Development Program (PDP)</a> from the UCSC
	Institute for Scientist & Engineer Educators (ISEE) which
	promotes STEM inquiry activities (i.e.,
	where learners particpate in applied investigations that teach
	STEM concepts).
	I worked in a team with 3 other participants, and we decided
	to design an inquiry on Bayesian
	statistical analysis (techniques that are commonly used in
	astronomical research).
	We had our students conduct investigations
	on exoplanet research, globular clusters, and identifying stars
	- all of which were based on real astronomy research projects.
	We taught this activity at the WEST program 
	for students transferring to UCSC from community colleges.
	A main theme in the PDP is equity and inclusion (through
	both inquiry design and facilitation). We
	incorporated these principles by providing
	multiple pathways to success in our activities and giving
	learners opportunities to see themselves as people
	engaged in authentic STEM practices. </h5>

	in a project to

	I am working with Prof. Peter Behroozi to reform his upcoming general
	education introductory (200-level) cosmology course in Spring 2019
	with Prof. Ed Prather, who specializes in astronomy education
	research.

      <h5> Finally, I've worked with the <a href="http://warrior-scholar.org/">Warrior Scholar Project</a>, an academic "bootcamp" for veterans returning to school, during their STEM week at the University of Arizona. In summer 2018, I created and led a week-long lab activity about data analysis and image manipulation (e.g., false-color images, making "images" out of data, etc.); in summer 2017, I co-led a week-long research lab about exoplanets (detectability, habitability, and orbit stability).</h5>

      <!--h5>In Spring 2017, I was the TA for an introductory astronomy course for non-majors that was taught in a planetarium theatre. I volunteered to give one of the lectures (Milky Way structure) and developed a lecture combining a traditional slideshow with planetarium software features. In the past, I have TA-ed for introductory physics courses, and while I was getting my MPP, I TA-ed for an economics course and tutored statistics (including statistical programming in STATA).</h5-->

      <h1>Public Policy</h1>
      <h5 class="padding-32">Between my B.A. in Astronomy/Physics (Univeristy of Virginia 2013) and starting my Ph.D., I earned a Master of Public Policy (MPP) degree from the <a href="http://batten.virginia.edu/">Frank Batten School of Leadership & Public Policy at the University of Virginia</a>. Through the program, I learned and practiced many general policy skills, including writing breifs, memos, and other articles as well as analyzing the effectiveness of policies. I applied these lessons in my internship with the <a href="http://www.aapt.org/">American Association of Physics Teachers (AAPT)</a>. For my MPP thesis, I wrote a policy analysis with AAPT on increasing gender diversity in physics, and I presented the results at the 5th International Conference on Women in Physics in Waterloo, Canada. </h5>

      <h1>Science Communication Training</h1>
      <h5 class="padding-32">In addition to education and policy experiences, I have attended trainings to enhance my science communication skills. I'm a <a href="https://aas.org/outreach/aas-astronomy-ambassadors-program">AAS Astronomy Ambassador</a> (Nov. 2014 workshop), and I participated in an <a href="http://www.aldakavlilearningcenter.org/">Alan Alda Center Science Communication Workshop</a> which used improvisation exercises to focus on how to engage audiences including the general public, media, and funding sources. In April 2017, I earned a digital badge through the University of Arizona Graduate College on <a href="https://backpack.openbadges.org/share/9cc1c5eb9c9cd1b653b2af3157d3f27d/">Presenting to Diverse Audiences</a>.</h5>
