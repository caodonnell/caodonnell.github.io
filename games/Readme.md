# PhysTEC-opoly

A themed version of Monopoly, using PhysTEC 5+ Club Awardees as properties and related items/events for other spaces. Since most teachers stay within about 50 miles of their teacher prep/certification programs, property costs are based on local costs of living and the rents are based on teacher salary schedules.
